# Unsupervised_Learning_Project
Unsupervised Learning Project

Project specifications:

Implement 3 well-known clustering algorithms (don’t pick K-means
whose implementation will be covered in the assignment), test them,
and compare their results to each other as well as to existing
publicly-available implementations of those algorithms (e.g., many such
implementation can be found in Python’ scikit-learn package). Analyze
the results.
